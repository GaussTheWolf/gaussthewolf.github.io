## Finally, a "new" look

I can now say that v1 of this website is complete. I was supposed to finish this
before 2024 started, but oh well. Kinda got sidetracked, and I didn't even get
to do everything I wanted, but oh well, at least I got plans for v2.

## Changelog

### The big things

- **New look**, based on Bootstrap, inspired by minima
- **Redesigned homepage**, I hope the cards look nice >w>
- **Dedicated category pages**, so my blog posts are now separated from my
coding projects
- **Blobfox emojis** :blobfoxuwu:
- **Dark mode**, to make all the vampires happy (including me)
- **Favicon**, simple and minimalistic
- **/now page** to tell you what I'm doing [now](/now/) (inspired by
[NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com))

### Internal stuff

- **Dedicated page types**, separating coding pages with blog posts
- **Upgrade to Bootstrap 5**, though I should move to something simpler
- **More easter eggs**, for example, can you make this site [gayer](/?gay)?

### Plans for v2

- **Tags**, and a dedicated page for every tag (though I don't think I have
enough posts for that yet...
- **Ad-blocker-blocker**, that recommends you install an ad blocker if you
don't already have one
- **Full-text search**, but done in a completely offline way, should be possible
if I don't have too much on my website
- **Less CSS**, that probably means getting rid of Bootstrap (will have to see
how much of the framework I end up using)
- **E2E testing**, if I have so much code on my website, I will want to make
sure my changes don't break it >w>
