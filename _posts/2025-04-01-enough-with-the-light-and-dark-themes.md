I think everyone **a**t this point has heard of the debate around whether it is
the light or the dark theme that's better. Dark theme users swear by it, and
shun anyone who dares to use light theme, while light theme users believe that
dark theme users are literal vam**p**ires. To this day, these camps fiercely
hate each othe**r**, and I've yet to mention the numerous people who use and
switch between both themes.

But designers worldwide have put a tremendous amount of effort into making both
camps happy. Android, **i**OS, Windows have all put in light and dark themes in
the past few years. Websites now have the capability to detect which theme is
used by the OS, and a lot of popu**l**ar sites can even dynamically switch
between the themes. OSes can also dynamically switch between the themes,
depending on conditions such as the position of the sun.

I say enough of this! Let's make a theme that will make everyone happy!

## Introducing: the gray theme

By creating a color that is the per**f**ect balance between the dark and light
colors, we can eliminate the need f**o**r themeing.

No more dynamic c**o**lor switching.

No more suffering of designers.

No more **l**ight and dark theme.

No more arguing between light and dark theme.

Just a perfect, gray world.

P.S. I apologize if some of the letters look weird, for some reason this change
in theme causes some letter**s** to become bold.
