On November 26, 2019, I replied to Stixil's Twitter account with this picture:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">STIX <a href="https://t.co/jgEzf0aX2k">pic.twitter.com/jgEzf0aX2k</a></p>&mdash; Gauss M.

This was the tweet that started it all. For 366 days, I've been consistently
terrorizing a gay traffic cone with a picture of ketchup flavoured Lay's Stix.

I never thought that something as silly as this could become so popular, or
go on for this long. But I guess if you do something for this long with this
amount of dedication, people will notice.

As a celebration, I decided to download every single tweet where I terrorized
Stixil with Stix, and do some analysis on them.

# Statistics

Overall, I have terrorized Stix with Stix **1106** times, for 1 year, or
**366** days, meaning on average, I terrorized Stix with Stix **3 times**
every day. That's a lot of terrorism.

The most likes I got for a terrorism was **60**, the least is 0 (obviously),
which I got for a total of **228** of my tweets. Retweets were even more rare,
with only **24** of my tweets getting retweeted once, and only
[one](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1290669656123080705){:target="_blank"}
of my tweets received 2 retweets, which is a video of an absolute abomination,
for which you can ~~thank~~ blame
[@GiraffeicsIF](https://twitter.com/GiraffeicsIF){:target="_blank"}.

Most times, I tweeted from my Android phone (**1084** times), but sometimes I'd
tweet from my web browser (**22** times).

Strangely, **none** of my tweets were marked as "possibly sensitive" for
certain audiences. I don't know to be happy or disappointed about that.

None of my tweets had location, except for
[one](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1302547754074415109){:target="_blank"}.

Most of my tweets Twitter correctly identified as being in English, but there
were some exceptions. In one case, Twitter thought I was writing
[Finnish](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1239999913586556930){:target="_blank"}
, in other cases I was apparently writing
[French](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1293790668893151233){:target="_blank"},
[Hindi](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1279870233814106117){:target="_blank"},
[Haitian](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1213470306028998656){:target="_blank"},
and
[Tagalog](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1243670563966550016){:target="_blank"}.

In two cases Twitter thought I was writing
[Polish](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1276754764970237953){:target="_blank"},
but actually, yeah I was actually writing
[Polish](https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1276754600570302465){:target="_blank"}.

Now comes the FAQ, which stands for questions you either you asked once, didn't
know you wanted to ask, or never asked.

# FAQ

**Q: Did you ever miss a day?** <br/>
A: Yes, **34** of them, to be exact. I've been consistent until **February 15**,
which was the first day I missed a terrorism. Then there is a 4 day skip
between **February 26 and 29**. The longest skip was **March 1 to 8**, but
after that there were only single-day skips, with the exception of
**October 15-16**.

**Q: Are you sponsored?** <br/>
A: No, I am not sponsored by any company to do this.

**Q: Why didn't you use a bot?** <br/>
A: There are multiple reasons.
1. I didn't want to reply to every tweet, only the funny/not serious ones.
1. I wanted to add a bit of personal touch to some of the tweets, like a
different text or image.
1. I wouldn't be praised for being dedicated, would I?

**Q: With the amount of Stix bags you’ve sent to Stixil Fox, what is the
biggest well-known structure (e.x. golden gate bridge) you can make with
them?** <br/>
A: First of all, yes, this is a question I actually got
[asked](https://twitter.com/CyrusIngrays/status/1269941812128595968){:target="_blank"}.
When I responded to that I made two mistakes: first, my estimation was way off,
I actually sent about **655** bags of Stix the time I tweeted that. But I was
also wrong about the weight: a bag of Stix is actually 70 grams, not 140.
So the weight I have to work with is actually **46 kilograms**, or in imperial
units, 655 bags of chips. But my answer is still correct, in that I could build
a child, meaning I made 2 mistakes and they somehow cancelled each other out.

Today I have sent **1106** bags of Stix, meaning the weight of that is about
**77 kilograms**. So I can re-create a human, or more specifically, a statue of
a human, which gives me a lot of options. I could make
[David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(Michelangelo)){:target="_blank"},
add another statue to
[Easter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island){:target="_blank"}
, or another member to the
[Terracotta Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army){:target="_blank"}.

**Q: Will you keep going?** <br/>
A:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">November 26 is gonna be Stixiversary? meaning I&#39;ll have been terrorizing Stix with Stix for an entire year <br><br>That&#39;s a long time, and the joke has been getting a bit old. I could either keep going, or stop on Nov 26 and have an epic finale. <br><br>Should I stop?</p>&mdash; Gauss M. Stallman (@LordOfTheYiffs) <a href="https://twitter.com/LordOfTheYiffs/status/1329378544733085696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The people have spoken, and said that I should keep going.


# Notes

I analyzed the data by getting an offline copy of all the tweets on
September 24. After that, I used a simple script to get the info on new tweets.
I ran it usually every day, and usually not after I tweeted. Because of this,
the like/retweet, and any other info that can change after tweeting, can be, and
on many of my tweets is, inaccurate.

You can download the data from [here](/assets/stix_terrorism_data.zip){:target="_blank"}
