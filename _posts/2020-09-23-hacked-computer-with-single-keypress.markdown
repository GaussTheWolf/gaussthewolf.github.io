title: How I hacked a computer with a single keypress

When I was in my university as a freshmen, I had an economics class.
Not sure why an IT engineer needs to know economics, but the class wasn't that
difficult, so oh well. The class was usually held in the big lecture hall, but
one time we moved to a smaller one. In there, the computer was a little bit
different and the teacher was unable to log in. So she calls the sysadmin
asking for the password, and he just says there is no password. Now, I have
been in that classroom for another class a many times before, so I've seen
teachers log into that computer many times. I asked if I can try logging in,
and she let me.

I went up to the computer.

I didn't type anything into the password box.

I just pressed enter.

And it logged in.

And that's how I hacked a computer with a single keypress.
